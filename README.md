# Zurich - Milan by Train

An interactive 3D web application built with the [ArcGIS API for JavaScript](developers.arcgis.com/javascript/), visualizing the train tracks between Zurich and Milan.

It highlights the new route that originated from the [NEAT](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NRLA) project, together with the time savings resulting from the three major tunnels going through the Swiss alps.
